## Overview

I use multy electrode array electrophysiology on awake and listening animals to record the responses of their auditory
cortex to sounds. I then use computational methods to model how past and ongoing sounds are represented by neurons in
a population and putative circuit of neurons. With this I hope to understand how the brain accumulates, transforms and relays
information, representations and abstractions, and how we can draw inspirations from these algorithms to engineer 
smarter artificial intelligence.

### Contextual representation and sparse coding

Keeping track of both past and ongoing stimuli is necessary for computation and cognition. However, how this working
memory is represented by the auditory cortext, and how this context of past stimuli modulates current response remains
unknown. We have found long-lasting contextual modulation in both the primary auditory cortex (A1) and the peri ectosylvian 
gyrus (PEG), a secondary auditory cortex region. This contextual modulation lasts hundreds of milliseconds, past beyond 
the archetypal integration window of A1 and PEG spectro-temporal receptive fields (STRF). Furthermore, it is distributed
in a sparse code across neurons in a local population. Finally, we have shown that models containing local synaptic 
connections, surrogate for recurrent connections, better capture the response of neurons to sound, alongside the 
aforementioned contextual modulation. See [A sparse code for natural sound context in auditory cortex
](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.14.544866).

### Short term plasticity and stimulus specific adaptations

There is extensive work on the physiology behind the multiple mechanism -both synaptic and neuronal- underlying short
term plasticity (STP), the ability of a neuron to modulate its response as a consequence of prior activity. However, we
don't fully understand how this STP acts in the context of populations and circuits of neurons encoding auditory
stimuli.
We have shown how short term plasticity happening independently for different spectral input channels can better
predict the recorded neural activity, and is also capable of recapitulating stimulus specific adaptation, a response
property seen across brain regions and species. See [Spectral tuning of adaptation supports coding of sensory context 
in auditory cortex](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007430)

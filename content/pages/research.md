## Overview

I use multy electrode array electrophysiology on awake and listening animals to
record the responses of their auditory
cortex to sounds. I then use computational methods to model how past and
ongoing sounds are represented by neurons in
a population and putative circuit of neurons. With this I hope to understand
how the brain accumulates, transforms and relays
information, representations and abstractions, and how we can draw inspirations
from these algorithms to engineer
smarter artificial intelligence.

### Contextual representation and sparse coding

Keeping track of both past and ongoing stimuli is necessary for computation and
cognition. However, how this working
memory is represented by the auditory cortext, and how this context of past
stimuli modulates current response remains
unknown. We have found long-lasting contextual modulation in both the primary
auditory cortex (A1) and the peri ectosylvian
gyrus (PEG), a secondary auditory cortex region. This contextual modulation
lasts hundreds of milliseconds, past beyond
the archetypal integration window of A1 and PEG spectro-temporal receptive
fields (STRF). Furthermore, it is distributed
in a sparse code across neurons in a local population. Finally, we have shown
that models containing local synaptic
connections, surrogate for recurrent connections, better capture the response
of neurons to sound, alongside the
aforementioned contextual modulation.

](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crneur.2023.100118).

### Short term plasticity and stimulus specific adaptations

There is extensive work on the physiology behind the multiple mechanism -both
synaptic and neuronal- underlying short
term plasticity (STP), the ability of a neuron to modulate its response as a
consequence of prior activity. However, we
don't fully understand how this STP acts in the context of populations and
circuits of neurons encoding auditory
stimuli.
We have shown how short term plasticity happening independently for different
spectral input channels can better
predict the recorded neural activity, and is also capable of recapitulating
stimulus specific adaptation, a response
property seen across brain regions and species.

in auditory cortex](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007430)

### Bee manipulation of flowers constrains foraging preference

A bee prefers visiting flowers of the same type. This “Flower constancy” is
advantageous for the plant, however the advantages for the bee are less clear.
A classic explanation lies in the cognitive cost of learning to discriminate
and remember the reward of multiple flower types. However less is known about
the cognitive cost of learning different manipulations required to gain access
to flower nutrients.
In order to understand this manipulation cost, we made a detailed
characterization of flower harvesting behaviors. Videos of bees mid-harvest
were analyzed using available deep learning tools to generate a dictionary of
constitutive movements, that are assembled into distinct flower manipulations.
We predict that flowers with very different manipulation will necessitate an
increased cognitive load and thus generate flower constancy.

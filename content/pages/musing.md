### Musings

How is it that a tangle of cells<br/>
uncomprehensible gordian knot<br/>
sees the universe, hears itself<br/>
a mere product of nature's brutal force<br/>

recursive fractal of systems<br/>
now egos beyond the neuron<br/>
less forcefull, wielding wisdom<br/>
weaves glass with light<br/>
controls the electron<br/>

old myths find new mysteries<br/>
in search of the common function<br/>
of flesh and silicon junction<br/>
a stride in human history

## About me

My PhD research focused on sound integration over time at
[Oregon Health & Science University](https://www.ohsu.edu/school-of-medicine/neuroscience-graduate-program)
in the group of [Dr. Stephen David](https://www.ohsu.edu/school-of-medicine/neuroscience-graduate-program).
<br/> I investigated how the contexts of recent sound changes the response to ongoing stimuly,
the physiological mechanisms underlying these effects, and how the representation of context
effects is distributed across a population of neurons.

I am also a historical fencer, climber, biker, and a dubious 
[comedian](https://mateo-lopez-espejo.github.io./pages/testimonials.html),
[poet](https://mateo-lopez-espejo.github.io./pages/musings.html) and philosopher.

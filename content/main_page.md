How is it that a tangle of cells<br/>
uncomprehensible gordian knot<br/>
sees the universe, hears itself<br/>
a mere product of nature's brutal force<br/>

recursive fractal of systems<br/>
now egos beyond the neuron<br/>
less forcefull, wielding wisdom<br/>
weaves glass with light<br/> 
controls the electron<br/>

old myths find new mysteries<br/>
what is the common secret
of flesh and silicon


About me
From biology and the function of the brain, to computersn and artificial inteligence. I am interested in how systems 
acumulated and process information. something about science fiction, phylosophy, and fencing.

Research
I am a Neuroscience PhD candidate at Oregon Health & Science University under the supervision of Dr. Stephen David. 
I am interested in understanding how the auditory cortex keeps track of past information in its representation of
current stimuli.
I use a combination of in-vivo, awake, multy electrode array electrophysiology and computational modeling, to understand
the complexities of how populations of neurons represent this past information.

Skills
I Am an electrophysiologyst and I code in python. I also know some machine learning.

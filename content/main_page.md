### Musings

How is it that a tangle of cells<br/>
uncomprehensible gordian knot<br/>
sees the universe, hears itself<br/>
a mere product of nature's brutal force<br/>

recursive fractal of systems<br/>
now egos beyond the neuron<br/>
less forcefull, wielding wisdom<br/>
weaves glass with light<br/>
controls the electron<br/>

old myths find new mysteries<br/>
what is the common secret<br/>
of flesh and silicon<br/>

### About me

I am currently a PhD candidate at the [Laboratory of Brain Hearing and Behavior](https://hearingbrain.org/) in the
[Neuroscience Graduate Program at Oregon Health & Science University](ohsu.edu/school-of-medicine/neuroscience-graduate-program)
working under the supervision of Dr. Stephen David.<br/>
My research focuses on how the brain keeps track of past stimuli, and how this temporal context influences
the representation of incoming stimuli. For more delails visit my research page.

I am also a historical fencer, climber, biker, jokester and a dubious poet and philosopher.
